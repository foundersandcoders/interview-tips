# interview-tips

A short guide to finding work after FAC. Here are some things I found out whilst interviewing and doing tests for jobs.


##Tests
The test I were given seemed to vary in length and difficulty, I were sent a couple that were aimed at more mid level developers, I found these quite hard, and each took about 2 days to complete.
+ State which version of node you developed on in your readme (I developed on Node vs4 and some of the depenancies I used were not compatabile with earlier verisons of node, the company picked up on this).
+ Write a good FAC style readme, which details clearly how to run the project (if its a github repo).
+ Familiarise your self with common design patterns (ie MVC)

I also completed some shorted test on [Codility](https://codility.com), I much prefered these as they did not take two days to complete (always nice :-) ). They have some practice examples which are helpful to go through.

##Interviews
+ Google language specific interview questions and have some answers prepared.
+ Also sell your soft skills gained at FAC, ie working in teams, teaching each other and managing clients, I found that employeers really liked this, and FAC has given us an excellent grounding in these skills.
+ If they throw you a problem you dont know the answer to (this happened to me), talk through how you would go about solving it, even if you dont know the answer.
+ Talk about how you learn new things (we have done lots of this at FAC so should be plenty to talk about).
+ Mention any extra circcular activities (ie Node Girls, Hackathons etc).
