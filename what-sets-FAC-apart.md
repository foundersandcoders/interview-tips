# How to explain FAC

FACsters may come across someone who is more familiar with other bootcamps e.g. Makers. You may have to explain what FAC is, but wouldn't want to end up selling this place to people rather than selling yourself.

Let's collate suggestions here about how to explain FAC and everything that it gives you, which you may not get elsewhere. Anyone is welcome to add more ideas to this!

This has been my response to that question:
> Without going through each course yourself, I guess it's always difficult to know, but I'd say there are some distinct differences:
> - FAC is purely JavaScript, i.e. Node in the backend (and Postgres in terms of databases)
> - The pre-requisits to get onto FAC (http://www.foundersandcoders.com/apply/) mean that a different amount of knowledge is expected before the start of the course.
> - We build a different project each week, in teams of 4. Students employ the practice of pair programming at all times
> - FAC don't allow the use of any frontend frameworks, or at least not in the taught portion of the course (the first 8 weeks). We also emphasise a thorough understanding of core Node.js, but towards the end, we do then allow the use of Hapi in the backend. Part of the reasoning behind the "no frameworks" rule is so that we fully appreciate what problems each framework is solving, and are able to therefore make more effective judgements on what to use. Another advantage is arming students with the flexibility to switch between technologies, as the popularity of each one can shift. And lastly, FAC values are heavily aligned with open source software. So I think the idea is also to enable students to contribute to and improve upon existing technologies.

That part became instrumental in writing the "no frameworks" explanation of our [house rules](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/general/house-rules.md)

> Perhaps the biggest difference is in the setup of the organisation:
> - FAC is a co-operative. Each student that goes through the course is welcomed into the business. My cohort is particularly heavily involved in the business meetings, since FAC is currently expanding. My personal role is to further our community outreach, by organising workshops for schools in the local area.
> - Each cohort is responsible for teaching the next cohort. So there is dedicated time at the end of each week to reflect on and suggest improvements to the curriculum and the teaching. The idea is that each curriculum is an iterative improvement upon the last one, and therefore all that has gone before it.
> - Each current cohort is collectively responsible for running FAC's weekly meetups, targeted towards people who are new to coding. This often attracts those who are interested in applying for the course, but is not exclusively for applicants. It is a chance for students to start mentoring early on, to gain experience in hosting events, and just pass on their knowledge in general.
