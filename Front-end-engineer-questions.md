# Front-end engineer interview tips

## Work on your portfolio
They want to see that you know what you're doing. The best way to do this is to have a body of work on Github (or actually deployed) that you can point to.

## Question time
You might not be asked to write out algorithms on a whiteboard but you will still be asked technical questions.
There are loooads of lists out there with front-end developer questions that are worth swotting up on.
Here are some of the ones that F&C members have been asked. Please add your own:

### Technical topics:
* Responsive design principles
* Best practices for loading assets quickly
* What is so cool about SVG? (With regards to optimisation)
* Making database calls from the front end
* General front-end performance questions
* Semantic HTML
* SEO
* What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JS? - `null` is for a value that is nothing. `undefined` is the absence of a value. Or a good analogy I was told: `null` - an empty box on a shelf; `undefined` - there is no shelf.
* What is transpilation and what are some issues with it?
* What is object-orientated programming, what's functional programming and what's the difference between them?
* What's a closure, when would you use them and when wouldn't you?
* What's the box model?
* Tell me about Elm (after I mentioned we're learning it - everyone seems interested when I mention it)
* How does Elm's type system, and typing more generally, work?
* What happens when you click a link? - If you want to go super deep you can go through [this](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)
* What does 'agile' mean? Four principles [here](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
* What's source control and why do you use it? Which ones have you used? What is different about Git?
* Describe different ways to create objects in JavaScript.
* Explain what is prototypal inheritance.
* How familiar are you with ES6 and talk me through some new ES6 features.
* What are some advantages of functional programming?
* Tell me about the BEM methodology (after I used it in a pair-programming session)
* How would you define good UX and how subjective it is? How would you convince a client that option A is better than option B in UX terms?
* How would you find a missing number in a sequence of consecutive numbers, e.g. `[1,2,4]`?
* How can you handle async flow with `Promises`?
* How would you write the following function `add(2)(3)`?
* What is the difference between `pipe` and `compose`?
* What is the difference between `currying` and `partial application`?
* Given an array of users how would you write a function that returns the total age of everyone whose name starts with letter `M` and who has been born after `1976`?

### General questions:
* What are your strengths and weaknesses?
* Do you prefer front-end or back-end?
* What is you favourite framework?
* What are you excited about in the tech world in the next 12 months?
* What projects do you have online that you can show us?
* How would you define 'quality'?
* What do you think about retrospectives?
* What story would you tell about F&C to someone thinking about applying?
* If you had to give an award to one person at F&C, who would it be and what for? - @cleo for being awesome at explaining things.
* What are the characteristics of a good software engineer?
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years time? (all time classic!)
* Tell me about a successful and a negative teamwork experience. What went well and what went wrong in both cases and how you dealt with it.

### Lessons learnt from interviews
- If you don't know the answer, just say so. Describe how you would approach the problem.
- Ask for questions and show them that you are interested. Do your research before you go.
- Highlight why the F&C course is special (have a look at @jsms90's lovely summary [here](./what-sets-FAC-apart.md)) and what you learnt during the course. People get very excited about the course and this reflects well on us as graduates. Don't forget to mention our mentoring role for the weekly meetups and for teaching the next cohort.
- Ask them if they want to see your projects, bring your laptop and be prepared to walk them through your work.
- Pen and paper or whiteboard if you need it to write down or explain your thought process.
