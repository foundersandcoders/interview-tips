# Front-end-engineer interview tips

## Work on your portfolio
They want to see that you know what you're doing. The best way to do this is to have a body of work on github or actually deployed that you can point to.

## Question time
You might not be asked to write out algorithms on a whiteboard, you will still be asked technical questions.
There are loooads of lists out there with front-end developer questions that are worth swatting up on.
Here are some of the ones that I have been asked. Please add your own:

### Technical topics:
* Responsive design principles
* Best practices for loading assets quickly
* What is so cool about SVG? (With regards to optimisation)
* Making database calls from the front end
* General front-end performance questions
* Semantic HTML
* SEO

### General questions:
* What are your strengths and weaknesses?
* Do you prefer front-end or back-end?
* What is you favourite framework?
* What are you excited about in the tech world in the next 12 months?
* What projects do you have online that you can show us?
