# Front-end-engineer interview tips

## Work on your portfolio
They want to see that you know what you're doing. The best way to do this is to have a body of work on github or actually deployed that you can point to.

## Question time
You might not be asked to write out algorithms on a whiteboard, you will still be asked technical questions.
There are loooads of lists out there with front-end developer questions that are worth swatting up on.
Here are some of the ones that I have been asked. Please add your own:

### Technical topics:
* Responsive design principles
* Best practices for loading assets quickly
* What is so cool about SVG? (With regards to optimisation)
* Making database calls from the front end
* General front-end performance questions
* Semantic HTML
* SEO
* What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JS? - `null` is for a value that is nothing. `undefined` is the absence of a value. Or a good analogy I was told: `null` - an empty box on a shelf; `undefined` - there is no shelf.
* What is transpilation and what are some issues with it?
* What is object-orientated programming, what's functional programming and what's the difference between them?
* What's a closure, when would you use them and when wouldn't you?
* What's the box model?
* Tell me about Elm (after I mentioned we're learning it - everyone seems interested when I mention it)
* How does Elm's type system, and typing more generally, work?
* What happens when you click a link? - If you want to go super deep you can go through [this](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)
* What does 'agile' mean? Four principles [here](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
* What's source control and why do you use it? Which ones have you used? What is different about Git?

### General questions:
* What are your strengths and weaknesses?
* Do you prefer front-end or back-end?
* What is you favourite framework?
* What are you excited about in the tech world in the next 12 months?
* What projects do you have online that you can show us?
* How would you define 'quality'?
* What do you think about retrospectives?
* What story would you tell about F&C to someone thinking about applying?
* If you had to give an award to one person at F&C, who would it be and what for? - @cleo for being awesome at explaining things.
