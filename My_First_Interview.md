My first Skype interivew is over and so I wanted to share the experience with you.

My heart rate was higher than the first time I asked a girl out but hopefully the outcome will be better!!

I felt a bit lucky because in the email exchange before I had been given an indication of how to prepare. Namely, 
I was asked to be ready to show and explain some of my code. This was a great reminder to only use best practices in your 
code because I struggled with some parts of it, trying to remember what things were meant to do and how they worked, which
would have been much easier had I had comments there or just had my code more readable.

Anyway, Skype rang and it was on.

First questions were
1) 'How did you get into coding, having studied an irrelevant degree?' 
2) 'What syllabus have you covered at Founcers & Coders?'

Then I was asked to show some of my code and talk about it. I first demonstrated my beloved To-Do-List app that I had built
in React, as this was a React position. I then asked which part of the code he would like me to talk about, trying to show
that I understand it in its entirety and am ready for anything. He said: 'show me how you delete stuff', I proceeded to 
explain. 

He then asked about other bits of the code and what they did.

Having finished this part of the interview, he noted that I demonstrated 'good basic understanding of React'.

He then proceeded to show and explain the software the company develops and the code behind it. This took a considerable 
chunk of time. In fact, this was the majority of the 'interview' as opposed to asking me questions, which I found strange. 

At the end he asked where I lived and what salary I was expecting. I said Â£27,000. He said they were aiming to pay less.

It was a short interview.
